# The Coder's Computer

The Coder's Computer is an incredibly valuable lesson apart of preparing your computer for coding. There are a handful of important software that can help create a healthy environment when learning to code 

**Visual Studio Code**

Visual Studio Code, otherwise named VS Code is a text editor for coding. It has multiple extensions that can be added to it to help make coding easier, as well, such as _HTML Boilerplate_ and _Auto Close Tag_.


**Ubuntu**

Ubuntu is a software operating system that allows you to code freely and interact with your computer's operating system.


**Git**

Git is a a distributed version-control system, which means it tracks changes in code to help manage software development more efficiently.

**Tree**

Tree is a command that shows the scaffolding of directories and folders in a terminal.

**Node**

Node is an environment that runs Javascript.

**NPM**

NPM is a package manager used in Node that helps install different programs from a variety of sources.

**ESLint**

ESLint is an analytic tool that helps identify errors in code and report back issues.


## Choosing a Text Editor

There are many different types of text editors available to coders. They all have different functions, and often depend on the type of operating system you are using. When choosing a text editor it's important to consider a few options and carefully weigh which one is best for you.

But what is a text editor?

A text editor is, simply put, a software that allows you to write and manage text. Simple as that. Despite it's ease of access, the text editor is the most important tool for coding. You have a few options when it comes to picking one. You can use the one that is already on your computer, or choose a third party one such as:

- NotePad++
- TextWrangler
- BB Edit
- Visual Studio Code
- Atom
- Brackets
- Sublime
- And many more!

The main few things to think about when choosing the best one for you is:

- Can I choose a variety of helpful extensions?
- Does it highlight the syntax?
- Can I choose a variety of themes to help with eye strain?
- Does it auto complete code when I start typing?

None of these are required, of course. But they're very helpful!

## The Command Line Cheat Sheet

There is a lot of different commands that you need to remember to navigate code, and the following is a simple cheat sheet to help guide you through the process. You can find out more about [The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php), [Basic Navigation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php) and [About Files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php) on [Ryan's Tutorials for Linux](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/).

- *Print Working Directory* `pwd` : A command that tells you your current working directory
- *List* `ls` : A command that tells you what's in your current directory - or your location within it.
  - `ls -l` : Display a long listing. A long list has the following:
    - First character indicates whether it is a normal file ( - ) or directory ( d )
    - Next 9 characters are permissions for the file or directory (we'll learn more about them in section 6).
    - The next field is the number of blocks (don't worry too much about this).
    - The next field is the owner of the file or directory (ryan in this case).
    - The next field is the group the file or directory belongs to (users in this case).
    - Following this is the file size.
    - Next up is the file modification time.
    - Finally we have the actual name of the file or directory.
  - `ls /etc` : Display the directories contents
  - `ls -l /etc` : Display a long list of the directories contents
  - `ls -a` : View hidden files
- *Change Directory* `cd` : A command that changes your location across directories
- *Files* : Everything is a file! Yes, even your keyboard is a file. Here are some examples of files:
  - `file.exe` - an executable file, or program.
  - `file.txt` - a plain text file.
  - `file.png`, `file.gif`, `file.jpg` - an image.
  - There are no spaces in names, they are case sensitive and if there is a period `.` in front of it, it's hidden.
