#Growth Mindset

A **growth mindset** is a crucial stage of thinking required to unlock _true_ potential and development when learning. The main ways to identify a growth mindset are:

1. Inviting and investing in challenges.
2. Taking on obstacles head on.
3. Giving your best effort no matter the challenge.
4. Adopting constructive critism.
5. Encouraged by the success of others.

With growth mindset being such a fundamental piece of success, there are a few things for me to keep in mind as I continue down this path of learning.

- Be comfortable with failing.
- "The Pit" is just part of the process.
- I am never alone, and can always reach out for help.
